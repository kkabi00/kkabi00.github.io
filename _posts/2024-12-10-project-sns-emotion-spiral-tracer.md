SNS Emotional Spiral Tracer is a prototype system for detecting emotional spirals on social media, aimed at preventing content addiction and emotional burnout.  
It was developed as a software engineering course project, where I served as team leader.

We extracted text data from video content and user comments to analyze emotional changes over time.  
Using sentiment analysis and temporal pattern detection, the system visualized emotional downtrends and flagged potential risks.

This project explored the intersection of mental health, social media behavior, and AIâ€”demonstrating the potential of affective computing in everyday platforms.
