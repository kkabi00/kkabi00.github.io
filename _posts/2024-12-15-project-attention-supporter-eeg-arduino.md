Attention Supporter is an embedded system that supports student concentration and automatically generates questions using EEG sensor data.  
The project was developed for an Embedded Software course, where I led the team and earned 1st place with an A+ grade.

The system measures focus levels through a brainwave-sensing EEG device connected to Arduino.  
It then triggers automatic question generation when attention drops, helping learners stay engaged during self-study.

This project combined hardware sensing with intelligent feedback, showcasing how physiological data can be used to improve learning experiences.
