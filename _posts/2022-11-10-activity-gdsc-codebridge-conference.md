In Fall 2022, I co-organized the **CODE BRIDGE Conference** at Google Startup Campus in Seoul, joined by over 150 student developers nationwide.  
The event was supported by Google Developer Groups and featured industry speakers in AI, blockchain, backend, and algorithm engineering.

My contributions included:

- Designing event materials (pamphlets, signage, stickers)
- Handling logistics and on-site coordination
- Communicating with external sponsors and partner chapters

This marked a major milestone in scaling cross-chapter collaboration and developer community visibility.
