In January 2024, I helped organize **NewYearThon**, a 1-night, 2-day national hackathon hosted by 16 GDSC chapters, with over 200 participants.  
The event was supported by GDG, innovation centers, and companies including NAVER.

Key responsibilities included:

- Branding and visual design
- Logistics coordination and participant support
- Securing sponsor contributions (goods, prizes, support funding)

The event addressed student demand for hands-on experience and strengthened inter-chapter developer networks.
