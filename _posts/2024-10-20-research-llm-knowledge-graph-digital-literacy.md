This paper proposes a framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graph structures to provide customized support for digital literacy education.  
The research was presented at the 2024 Fall Conference of the Korean Society for Smart Media.

The framework dynamically analyzes a learner's digital behavior and comprehension using LLMs, and maps this information to a personalized knowledge graph.  
By doing so, it enables tailored recommendations, contextual learning assistance, and a deeper understanding of the learnerâ€™s progress.

We focused on bridging the gap between generative AI and structured knowledge representation, demonstrating the system's potential in real-world digital education environments.
