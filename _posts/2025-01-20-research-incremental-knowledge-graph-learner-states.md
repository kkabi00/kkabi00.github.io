In this study, we proposed an incremental knowledge graph construction system designed to diagnose learner states from online lecture videos.  
The paper was presented at the 2025 Winter Conference of the Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS), held in YongPyong, Seoul.

The system processes multimodal features—such as speech transcripts, facial expressions, and visual cues—to infer student comprehension and engagement in real time.  
Using a modular pipeline, the framework connects entity-relation extraction with temporal graph updates, allowing for flexible representation of learning dynamics over time.

This research contributes to the field of educational technology by enhancing the adaptability of AI-driven feedback systems and supporti
