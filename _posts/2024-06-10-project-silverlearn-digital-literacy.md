SilverLearn is a customized recommendation system designed to support digital literacy among the elderly during South Korea's digital transformation.  
As team leader, I led the development and design of the service, which won the Grand Prize at the 2024 Digital Innovation Idea Competition hosted by the Busan Information Industry Promotion Agency.

We utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the digital behavior and knowledge levels of senior users.  
The system then provides personalized educational content and platform navigation guides based on their digital competencies and needs.

This project addressed both technical and social challenges, aiming to bridge the digital divide and enhance technology inclusion for older populations.
