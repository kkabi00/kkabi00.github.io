In Fall 2024, I worked as a teaching assistant for a graduate-level course on Large Language Models (LLMs).  
The course covered core NLP theory, transformer architectures, prompt engineering, and hands-on application of generative models.

My responsibilities included:

- Supporting code implementation and model fine-tuning sessions
- Assisting with prompt design assignments and evaluation
- Clarifying LLM evaluation metrics and inference mechanics

This role strengthened my ability to communicate complex model behavior and support research-oriented graduate learners.
