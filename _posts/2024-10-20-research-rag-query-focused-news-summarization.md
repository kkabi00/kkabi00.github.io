This research presents a query-focused news summarization method using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
The study was presented at the 2024 Fall Conference of the Korean Society for Multimedia, held in Jeju, Korea.

We designed a framework that retrieves relevant context based on user queries and generates summaries that emphasize user-specified information needs.  
The system integrates dense passage retrieval with a generative language model to produce coherent and focused summaries from news corpora.

This approach offers enhanced control and interpretability for summarization systems, especially in use cases requiring concise, query-driven news analysis.
