This paper explores how knowledge graphs can be designed to enable public administration services through digital twin systems.  
The work was presented at the 2024 Fall Conference of the Korean Society for Multimedia, held in Jeju, Korea.

We developed a model that structures administrative processes, spatial data, and citizen interactions within a graph-based representation.  
The digital twin platform synchronizes real-world public service events with a virtual model, allowing for intelligent service delivery, simulation, and prediction.

Our approach highlights how knowledge graphs can bridge data infrastructure with operational workflows in government contexts, especially in urban planning and real-time policy feedback.
