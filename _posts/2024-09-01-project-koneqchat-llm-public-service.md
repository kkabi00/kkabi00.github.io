K-OneQ Chat is a language model-based chatbot designed to improve access to public services for foreign residents in Korea.  
As team leader, I led this project as part of the 2024 GovTech Startup Competition.

The chatbot leverages large language models to answer questions regarding immigration, healthcare, employment, and daily livingâ€”often difficult for non-Korean speakers to navigate.  
We focused on multilingual response accuracy, domain-specific retrieval, and government data integration.

By combining LLM capabilities with public service data, K-OneQ Chat demonstrated how AI could promote inclusion and lower barriers in digital government access.
