In Winter 2025, I served as a teaching assistant for an intensive program focused on Kubernetes and Docker for undergraduate students.  
The program aimed to introduce containerization and orchestration concepts through hands-on labs and mini-projects.

As TA, I supported:

- Lab session preparation and live debugging
- Guidance on container builds, deployment, and networking
- Providing feedback on DevOps pipeline mini-projects

This experience allowed me to support peer learning while deepening my own expertise in scalable infrastructure tools.
